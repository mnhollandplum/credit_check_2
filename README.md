# Questions

1. What are you proud of?
I am proud of writing me initial code that output whether or not the card number was valid. I am proud that I was able to create a class and move my original code into that class and make them into methods. I am proud that I was able to create make a git repository and push it to GitHub.
1. What do you need to improve?
My understanding of methods, avoiding basic syntax errors and asking for help earlier.
1. What questions do you still have?
Where to start with the exercises. I would like to go over minitests again.

# Rubric

## Functionality - 2

Notes: I got about halfway through iteration 2. I was able to create a git repository, push my file there, create a branch. I began working on creating a class but am still working on making it output the expected output.

- [ ] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics - 3

Notes:

The student(s): Nikki Holland-Plum

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design - 3

Notes: Nikki Holland-Plum

The student(s):

- [?] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing - 0

Notes: Did not reach this point for this project.

The student(s): Nikki Holland-Plum

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control - 2

Notes:

The student(s): Nikki Holland-Plum

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
